This program creates an auth database, initialize some basic users, add API user, and remove user.

When running "AuthDbCreator.exe filePath", it will create Sqlite database.
Without arguments, this will create a database according to connection string in appsettings.json.

Just run "CreateBlankSqlite.bat" for setting up auth.db for the Web service PoetryApp.
